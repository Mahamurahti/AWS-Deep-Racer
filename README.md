# AWS DeepRacer

Documentation of my AWS DeepRacer model. Model done during AWS DeepRacer event held at Sanoma. Creation of a model and training of the model was sponsored by AWS.

Model was trained on `re:Invent 2018 - Counterclockwise` track.

Race type is `Time trial`.

## Planning:

The model was inspired when scanning through the provided parameters. The parameter `waypoints` caught my eye and decided to use `closest_waypoints` parameter as my base:

![AWS DeepRacer Waypoints Graph](resources/waypoints.png)

Image above is from `re:Invent 2018 - Counterclockwise` track and shows the tracks waypoints.

## Model

As the model I used the waypoints graph to my advantage to train the model.
Main focus was using `closest-waypoints` parameter and staying on the center line.

See `model.py` to see the model.
